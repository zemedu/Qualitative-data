I- How do you think about covid 19?
P1- What I think about covid 19 is that it is dangerous transmitted
disease and has no definitive drug. It is rapidly transmittable and
caused widespread problem.Therefore covid 19 is deadly transmitted
disease...I think.
I- How do you think about covid 19 vaccine?
P1- As I heard about covid 19 vaccine, it is being given in many parts of
the world including our country. I think it was produced in short time
period while vaccine for other disease usually take long time. Because of
this ,its effectiveness can be questioned. However, I appreciate
scientists for their effort to produce this vaccine because it has saved
many lives....I think.
I- Who do you should get vaccinated?
P1- The first priority should be given for health care workers followed
by young adults.Most of time, I hear that older people should get
priority but I think in opposite way. Young adults are the base of
country's economy and it is better to invest much on this individual than
investing older people who can do little for country's development.
I-Have been vaccinated?
P1- No, I have not been vaccinated. At the begining, I didn't get the
chance of getting vaccine.Other people were taking it secretly and
vaccine brought for health professionals was being given for those who
have relatives calling by telephone.I have witnessed this. What came to
my mind at that time was that people save one's own relatives and let the
other die. If I have had opportunity that time ,I would have been
vaccinated. Later on when the vaccine came for all, however, I started to
doubt about the vaccine because I had no information about it. Now, if I
get enough information about the vaccine, I may change my mind and get
vaccinated.
I- How do you think about covid 19 vaccine for children
P- I have heard that covid 19 vaccine was started to be given in some
countries like china.But in our country, I am not sure whether covid 19
vaccination is allowed. Even if it is allowed, I will not be willing to
allow my children to receive vaccine because I have no much information
about vaccine reliability in children since there was no adequate
research done in children compared to adult.....I think. Second,
children take many other vaccine and I have a fear that it may cause harm
children altogether.
I- Do you think religion has affected your attitude toward covid 19
vaccine?
P1- No, I don't think. Religious leaders themselves are getting
vaccinated and teaching others to take it. So, I don't think my religion
has negative impact on vaccination.I believe the knowledge has been given
and If I don't take covid 19 due to religious purpose,I should not also
take other drugs and vaccine. So, my religion did not prevented me taking
covid 9 vaccine. I think like this.
I- If covid 19 vaccine is permitted for children, do you your children
get vaccinated?
I- I don't think it was tried to much in children.Therefore, I don't is
reliable and safe in children.I have a fear that it may harm or cause
serious side effects in them. Also, I have heard that children has
natural protection against covid 19 and they don't benefit much. I
general, I have no much information about covid vaccine in children under
age 18. If I get adequate information, I may allow them to get
vaccinated.
I- What is your concern about Covid 19 vaccine effectiveness,side effect
and potential complication, convenience?P1- I'm not sure about its effectiveness but I don't think it is 100%
effective. I need more information on this issue. Coming to
complication, I hear that It can cause blood clot and related
complication. About convenience, I think it is better to think the worst
side. For example, breathing with mask is not convenient but much better
than being in hospital and breathing with oxygen.Likewise, covid
vaccination may not be convenient. It may cause pain and discomfort but
it saves life. So, convenience may not be my big concern.
I-How do you see the role of media on covid 19 vaccine
Dr Gutu, [12/14/2021 8:27 AM]
?
P1-I Yeah, Media plays major role in providing information. This is what
was saying before. Previously, all medias were taking about covid and
covid vaccine. And this may have provided some understand about the issue
even if full information was not obtained. However, currently, attention
of media is diverted to political issues and information delivery about
covid/covid vaccine is significantly reduced. So, I want the government
to pay attention on this deadly disease.Age-26, Sex- Female,

I- What do you think about covid 19?
P- I know it is disease caused by virus and found in china in 2019 then
spread to other part of the world and Ethiopia. It is a disease that has
killed many lives...What I know.
I- What do you think about covid 19 vaccine?
P- I have no much information about covid 19 vaccine but from what I
hear, it is being given for some people. The virus is changing itself
from time to time and I think vaccine produced for one type of virus
doesn't work for the new virus. I don't know the reason for this to
happen.
I- Who you think should get the vaccine?
P-I think it should be given for health care workers, older people,
people with different disease like HIV, Diabetes, heart disease. Health
care workers usually have contacts with many people with Covid 19.
Therefore, they should get vaccination to protect themselves and to
decrease transmission of virus to other patients who who have no covid 19
and under their care. Ok said older people and people with different
disease should get vaccination because they have reduced ability to
prevent the disease and the disease in such people is usually severe. So
they should be given priority than other people.
I-Have you been vaccinated?
P-I did not receive it. Because, I don't have adequate information about
the vaccine. I don't know from where it was came, from what it was made.
From what I read on facebook, the vaccine was made from abortus aborted
for different reason.But I am not sure whether this information is true
or false. I need more information from reliable source.Another reason why
I didn't take the vaccine is that different people relate the vaccine to
different symbols like '666'. This might be true or false. Due to these
reasons, I am not interested to take the vaccine.
I- Was there any influence from religious leaders?
P- No, I have not heard any thing from religious leaders. They don't say
take it or don't take it. I decided not to take the vaccine by myself. It
is not good to tell false information.
I-What do you think about covid 19 vaccine for children?
P-As I hear from different sources, the vaccine is recommended for people
older than age 18. I have no idea for children less then 18 years old. I
didnt hear this so far. I don't think it is safe for children. It may
cause some problem if given for them. I doubt.
I- what is concern about covid 19 vaccine: Effective as, safety,
complication, convenience?
P- I have some concerns related to the vaccine. About the effectiveness,
I think its average between good and bad. I dont think its protection
against the disease is 100% even if you take full vaccine. The
effectiveness may also vary from one type of vaccine to another type. In
general, one can get COVID-19 disease even after vaccination.For example,
my child was vaccinated for measles and she has been infected with
measles like illness that I doubt it to be measles. Covid vaccine may be
the same. About the side effects, it may cause covid like symptoms for
short period of time.Lastly, it may not be convenient vaccine. It may
cause pain at injection site. But still its benefits out weighs
harm.....I think like this.
I- If covid vaccine is available for children, would you let your child
be vaccinated?P- No, I never. I did not take it by myself. How could I allow my child
vaccination without taking for myself? In children, the side effects may
be severe than in older people. Also, I have suspicion on its benefits
for children.So, I don't allow my child to get vaccination.
I- How do you see the role of media on covid 19 vaccine?
P- Media can provide more information on unclear issues about the
vaccine. Example, how much it is effective, what people expect after
getting vaccinated and which vaccine is good or bad.
I- Anything you want to add?

Question ? what do you say about Covid-19?
Answer? “If it is the wrath of God, he will calm us down, but I do not
say so much is a
devil but we must be patient and wait until God returns what He has
brought us. After all, it's just a matter of praying because there is
nothing else we can do
Question: What do you say about the corona virus 19 vaccine?
Answer? About the vaccine...? Of course it is said, 'Get vaccinated. And
there are some rumors that I am afraid of There is coagulation, there is
one who dies after being vaccinated three times and some two times. But
what should we be sure of? Because we are not that's for sure!!! There is
a distorted view it’s a little difficult. Because of that, I will not
take it; There is a blood clot ? we know the dead who took three rounds.
However, I did not take it because it was a little difficult. My aunt
From A.A told me about a man who had died after being vaccinated all
three. I do not see most people are dying, as people say Even if he does
not take all three the person who took the two series is dying. I will
not take it for granted until I am sure. The vaccine should be given to
people with a really comorbid disease. But ... now which is most
recommended to take is, if have kidney heart and liver disease. But to do
this also people are not sure. The idea is spreading not only me most of
their views is like this. I think it protects against moderation but I'm
not entirely sure. I heard health professionals talking.
Question: are you vaccinated against corona virus-19? Why
Answer: I am not vaccinated. In addition to uncertainty, I think God will
pass us by. If we are careful, If we take the necessary precautions,
whether we get the vaccine or not, God is the key and I am not sure my
main thought is that just being careful is enough.
Question: What you have heard about the Corona Virus-19 childhood
vaccine? What do you say?
Answer: I have not heard, but I still do not know how sure it is. Still,
my idea is the same. I will not take my child out of the house as much as
possible, except for the church. Other than that, I will not let a child
take what I am not sure about myself. But if there is a compelling reason
to do so, we have no reason to not take it. Not by religion sincerely I
can't say it's religious but it could be God's wrath because of our sins.
But we must wait patiently for God to eradicate it.
Question: What do you think about the safety of the Corona Virus-19
childhood vaccine? Answer: Of course, sometimes on television some people
have their own ideas. But there is a saying that it does not save much
completely. From this point of view, I believe that although I take it
the main thing is from God, so I will be as God unless God ends it. But
now that another idea has come up, I will not change my mind. How safe is
it? Many people have been vaccinated but have been dying steadily. But
when you hear it, your mind is troubled, so why not take a moment to look
at it? Because there is something about why it is taken It is better to
be careful with God. But it is better with God; I don't think you will
take it, You say you will be saved when someone dies there. With caution,
of course caution I must be careful, is a must, I will take care of me to
the best of my ability. Sanitizer means stay away from people; I will be
as careful as I can to the best of my ability. But more so until Goderadicate it I don't think anything will change but God will change us
for the better.
Q: What is the effect of various sources on your perception of the
Coronavirus-19 vaccine?
Answer: Of course, the government also provides information for the
benefit of the people. But I also have friends who have been vaccinated.
But some i
hurts a lot here. It hurts so much to be vaccinated, It has an impact.
Before I told you again why it is said that a person gets vaccinated and
dies has another effect. But with blood clots, death, and other cases It
is not said that absolutely sure I think it it affects. I also saw those
who were vaccinated, Of course at least two rounds are vaccinated; I've
seen a lot of people get vaccinated. But their hands are so swollen that
it hurts for so many days. When you see it, I do not think it is any
other option but to pray to God. Probably vaccinated is according to his
faith I will not impact on him. Saying why vaccinated. Why? Because he
believed in it as his own will. I have no objection, but here I am
thinking of myself. Everything that society talks about is sometimes
self-evident and it is on such such thing. Of course, the government once
introduced it to the people, but it is the right thing to do what I have
heard from people again, there is not much certainty about other
countries it was the only one what bothered me because it had something
to say. Taking unverified is bothering so follow cautions.Age 33, Sex F, Education degree, Occupation Governmental

Question: What do you say about Corona virus 19?
Answer: E…I know that corona is a serious and deadly disease.At the very
beginning, our understanding of Corona was not so great.But later we lost
thousands of lives we love them they love us.So after that my view of
corona virus is very high and it makes me very cautious because corona
virus is a terrible disease for me. People, some say that corona virus is
a disease that the government has deliberately brought in to reduce the
population, some thought it was a disease created by China; People
brought many kinds of views. I think Coronas is a disease nothing
special. If we are careful, we can easily save ourselves.Other than that,
my view is corona is a disease that is my view.
Question: What do you say about the corona virus 19 vaccine?
Answer: In terms of the vaccine….By the way, I was not vaccinated. I… am
one of the people who are afraid of the vaccine. Some say It is a vaccine
that can be used to kill people in a short period of time, Some say that
I lost my health after taking the vaccine, Some say it is normal but
people take it in tension, There are those who claim that the vaccine has
no side effects E... .Now my attitude has started to change. Especially
there was a campaign now. There have been various works on Facebook and
twitter that have changed our perception of the virus. After that, I
changed my attitude and realized that the vaccine is important to prevent
infection. But I am also one of those who afraid and have not been
vaccinated until recently. Anyone over the age of 18 should get the
vaccine but I did not get it. So my view was that the vaccine is very
serious. If possible no age limit for coronavirus vaccine, even if it is
5 years old, because there are children in school, day care and I would
like if coronavirus vaccine given from 5 years of age. If given to
everyone from infancy
Question:Have you vaccinated against corona virus-19?
Answer: I was not vaccinated because I did not have a good view of the
vaccine as I told you before. It is said that in a short time, the
vaccine kills people, It causes various ailments, it causes fainting, the
people who took it first said because that was inside me I did not get
the vaccine. By Geda it was announced you should have to vaccinated. I
did not face any challenges from a religious point of view. There were
people who took it at that time and there were people who said they were
sick, there were people who said I faint, So, I said if this is a
medicine, why it happened and that is why I did not take it?
Question: What do you think about childhood corona virus-19 vaccine?
Answer: I now understand a little bit and I believe the vaccine is
important.So if the vaccine is needed, the victims are children, on
different occasions they play each other, meet at the school as I said
before because of in retention places what the say. First of all I think
it would be better if it was given to children from an early age. So, if
it starts for children, I am very happy for myself.. I am willing and
ready to vaccinate my child if the vaccine comes in.Because first, I want
my child not to be infected with the corona virus and If he does get the
vaccine, the virus is adapted to it, so even if he catches it, it will
not affect him in any other way, so that's why he got vaccinated.
Question: What do you think about the safety of the corona virus-19
vaccine for children?Answer: When the vaccine is given to children, for
example, when we give them a 45-day vaccine they will be febrile all day
long and will growl, behave differently, just like that.When we get
vaccinated, it gets inside us, It is now a problem of lack of awareness,
s I said before, the corona virus came, but It is not built on
perception. So if it works on priority awareness, all mothers are sure tovaccinate their babies. This 45-day vaccine is well-run, after it has
done on it yes? Like that I don't think it bothers me much because I
understand now.Awareness needs to be worked on and explain the extension
to people so that they have a consistent knowledge. Awareness! it is the
thing, this is the advantage, this is the disadvantage . But the benefits
outweigh the disadvantages.So if this is done 1-2-3 these minor things
are not right these are the right ones. So children should get the
vaccine. If people believe and understand, no mother will be afraid to
vaccinate her child. I don't have a problem right now. I'm ready my child
to get vaccinated, I'm ready to get the vaccine myself now after gaining
the understanding.So I don't care if a child is vaccinated.
Question: What are the implications of sources of information for your
CVD-19 vaccine perspective?
Answer: This is the right page for me on Facebook as much as possible am
currently following up on information released by the Health institute .
Second, there are reports that when it comes to new TV broadcasts, there
are a lot of things that are being broadcasted on FB there is
information. If I make sure those are correct that's it often that's it I
take information and I have never had to worry so much about its reality.
Because I see daily any real information on Facebook, on Twitter is not
much problem for me. I get information from those. Ehh….I trying to see
it by google that I have just heard from other people.So, if it is true,
I will take it. If it is not true, then this is a lie.I will prove it
with the right source. In my opinion, the impact of different sources of
information is significant. It was high at first. that was one of the
reasons I didn't get the vaccine. Ehh…..In particular, there was an issue
on the twitter page about the Corona virus, which was released on a
foreign site It was only later that they fixed it, but they were
terrifying especially, it is associated with the vaccine. Ehh… which
describes it was to reduce the population so, was written many times.
Then I even read it one day, I read that people who have been vaccinated
against coronavirus will die of after 2 years that was a huge impact on
me. What I read impressed me more than I could hear here. But later on,
when I read the right ones, it was not right, because I saw the benefits
of taking coronavirus and now it does not affect me.
Question ?If there is anything you want to add?
Answer: The query is great, but if you do well now on perception, there
are some who cannot read.There are people even who do not have the
opportunity to hear the news and if you do well on those people. Now
that I have had my mother vaccinated, I have explained so much to her.
And I was saying it is especially important for you in terms of age.But
there are people who are not aware. There are people who say that it is

Question: What do you say about Corona virus 19?
Answer: Covid is a pandemic that shook the whole world. Eh…. then we
often believe it was deliberately fabricated by people. It is called
nothing by existing information is just this. I also think like that.
Mean it is a deliberately fabricated pandemic.
Question: What do you say about the corona virus 19 vaccine?
Answer: I think the vaccine is good. Many pandemics have happened here on
earth. For most of either vaccine or medicine is gained and like that
Eh….to adapt the virus the vaccine is good availability is good. But we
don’t know the future side effect mean for me now most people are taking.
But what kind of side effect does it have for their babies, especially
for pregnant women and nursing mothers? It is difficult for me to predict
the consequences for the normal human being. People with comorbidities,
people with hypertension, older people with weakened immune systems, so I
say if they helped with this vaccine. I say, because it is like the flu
resistance to the disease is lower than the normal and youth person,
people with comorbid conditions and like is better to them to take the
vaccine. First it was told to us fom health professionals and the other
thing is from the real experience from our villages the one who died from
covid are elders, people with comorbidity. We have seen they were realy
in problem and even who recover from yhe disease were in serious problem
Eh…. Most of people who we loss were like this then first information and
second also this thing was really happened in between us.
Question: have you vaccinated against corona virus 19?
Answer: I did not take it, as I told you before I feed breast and Because
I was afraid of what kind of side effect a child would have in the future
And I tried to see if there were any studies, nothing and I consulted
health professional nothing said. It is not said whether they take it or
not. I did not take it because I was afraid of this unproven fact.
Question: What do you think about childhood corona virus-19 vaccine?
Answer: It is difficult, especially for those between the ages of 10 and
12. Who are above that may be . Eh….one the vaccine has its own side
effect mean for example most people show at least half of the symptoms we
experience when we have corona it could be a headache. Because in some
people the side effect is noticeable better for children who able to
resist it. It is not for the future, but for children under 13 years of
age, the fever is so severe that it is difficult to get over anything
else, perhaps 13-18 years old. Instead, tell me what you think. It would
be easier for me to take what we do when we have the flu, trying to
increase the immune system of the children in different ways like food.
Question: If the Coronavirus-19 vaccine comes in, will you allow your
child to be vaccinated?
Answer: No, I did not, because my child is only two years old. So, first
of all, as I explained to you, I do not intend to vaccinate but to
increase the immune system. If there are studies that have been done on
the ground and the developed countries are doing what the best exporter
countries are doing, then I can change my mind if I am convinced by the
study, but in my current situation I will not allow.
Question: What do you think about the safety of the corona virus-19
vaccine for children?Answer: I have no other than what it will bring tomorrow I think it is
because they are human beings I think people are the ones who released
this disease in the laboratory. Eh… I have fear what it will produce for
future through process. I have nothing else. It has nothing to do with
culture or religion.
Q: What are the implications of information source for your CVD-19
vaccine perspective?
Answer: Because there is as much confusion as possible I try to check as
much as I can from some of the online internet and studies. Since
everything may not be right, I try to quantify what I have heard from the
media and whether they are correct. It has a profound effect on my
thinking. At a time when covid was come in I was in home I did not go out
Information I hear at home just like when my husband came out, and come
in we were just terrified. We do not want to be touched as soon as he
come Wash should be done with extreme care it should be and it is
correct. But when I heard it at home, there was a lot of information,
because it created fear in me. I was in much fear. Later, when I began to
go out, I began to see the situation in a different light, and it had a
profound effect on me.
Question ? If there is anything you want to add
Answer: If there is a study of this covid vaccine with breastfeeding
mothers and pregnant mothers, If anything recently, it would be nice if
it would be told to us. It would be good if health professionals could
teach us what these people have, what benefits or disadvantages. If the
information comes from a health professional, there is no doubt about it.Age- 42, Sex- male, Educational status- masters, Marital status- married,

Interviewer- what do you think about the coronavirus?
Respondent- During the beginning, I was so afraid when I see other
countries. Because we have seen how many Italians, Americans, and other
European country citizens were dying. Currently Compare with other
countries in our country coronavirus is not a big deal. Maybe genetically
we can resist the pandemic.
Interviewer- so, you are telling me the difference between our and other
countries is by resisting the coronavirus
Respondent- for example when we see Americans and Europeans they are
highly affected by the number of deaths and the number of infected
people. I can say in our country there is a great difference and it
doesn't affect that much. Of course, it has some impact on our economy.
My concern regarding the coronavirus was during the beginning and
currently has a difference. Personally, nowadays I don't bother about the
pandemic.
Interviewer- why don’t care currently about the corona?
Respondent- when we see the prevalence of the disease in my residential
area I didn't see anyone who is infected by the coronavirus. But there
are rumors those who have a comorbid chronic illness will die if they are
infected by the coronavirus.
Interviewer- what do you think about coronavirus vaccination?
Respondent- when I heard the vaccination was found I'm very happy about
that, but I have some concerns regarding the effectiveness of the
vaccination. Is the coronavirus a disease or the western created by
themselves? Is the virus doesn't infect those who are vaccinated? In our
country is that a vaccination big deal because we are not affected that
much by corona like other countries. I am suspicious about the vaccine
and I don’t trust the vaccine.
Interviewer- which group of people are supposed to take the vaccine in
your perception?
Respondent- those who are elderly, and who have the comorbid disease
should take the vaccine. Because, if they have another disease they can't
resist it. In addition, giving the vaccine to children above age 5 will
be good. Like elders children also can't resist disease.
Interviewer- what do you think about the adult population?
Respondent- Of course I'm not saying the adults should not be vaccinated,
but adults can resist the virus. Even the coronavirus by itself affects
those who have a low immune system.
Interviewer- Are you vaccinated?
Respondent- yes I got vaccinated
Interviewer- Why you get vaccinated?
Respondent- Based on what is really on the ground most of the time I
spend my time with my students, so if I didn't vaccinate there will be a
covid infection from the students to me or from me to the students. In
addition, I have family and children to protect myself and my family I
took the vaccine.
Interviewer- what do you think about the coronavirus vaccine for
children?
Respondent- it is a good thing, but I don't know the exact age of the
children who can take a vaccine.
Interviewer- what do you think about the safety of the corona vaccine for
children?
Respondent- in my perception the government and health workers are not
creating awareness for the people about the vaccine. Even the adults
don’t have awareness about the vaccine side effects or other issues.
Simply they are taking the vaccine by afraid of the pandemic without
awareness of side effects. For example, I got vaccinated, but I havequestions about the vaccine. So the government and health workers should
create awareness for the parents before the vaccine to children.
Interview- what kind of suspicion do you have about the vaccine to
children?
Respondent- there are rumors about the vaccine. The vaccine is become the
cause of a disease like blood problems and another disease. And also I
heard the vaccine is 666 or Illuminati. After you get the vaccine and
certificate for the vaccine the 666 will be mixed with your blood by
magic. The westerns did the vaccine purposely to control the other people
by the vaccine. The vaccine is fake and we don't know what will be the
long-term consequences of the vaccine. So, before giving the vaccine to
children the government has to create awareness about the rumors to the
parents by a panel discussion or by media.
Interviewer- how do you see the coronavirus vaccine to children with side
effects?
Respondent- I have two concerns the first thing is rumors about the
vaccine that has an impact on blood and the second we are black may be
the westerns want to harm us by the vaccine.
Interviewer- the pandemic is created by the westerns intentionally?
Respondent- yes I have that kind of suspicion. Of course, the pandemic is
not only the westerns it also affects our country. But I have an opinion
that starting from the beginning the virus is created by the people. The
virus takes out from the laboratory. So, they created the disease and
they also want to give the vaccine for the disease created by themselves.
I think it will have some kind of negative impact on us.
Interviewer- so they make it intentionally
Respondent- yes it has a negative psychological impact like fear and so
on
Interviewer- how do you see the vaccine regarding its effectiveness?
Respondent- regarding this issue, I don't have that awareness, because
I’m hearing from the media. Currently, those who are infected by the
virus are those who are not vaccinated. In our country, I don’t have any
information weather the vaccinated people are infected or not, but in
western the people who are infected by the virus are those who didn’t
take the vaccine. This indicates the vaccine is effective.
IN- Will you vaccinate your children?
Respondent- yes I’m ready, but I have concerns. I have never heard of the
children infected by covid-19 this is the characteristics of covid. The
people who are infecting currently are adults and old age people, so if
the children are not infected by the pandemic what is the need for the
vaccine for children.
Yes still needs more research on children's vaccines if I get a piece of
clear information from the health workers I’m ready to vaccine my child.
Interviewer- how do you see the impact of media on children's
vaccination?
Respondent- if it is about the generally covid vaccine there are a lot of
promotions on different media, but regarding child vaccination and its
effects on the child, I didn't see any media talk about the child
vaccine.

distance from other people we can protect from the corona.

Respondent- Until now I didn’t vaccinate, but after this time I’m ready

Interviewer- Which group of people are supposed to take the vaccine in
your perception?

Respondent- those who are elders above 40 have to take the vaccine. Those
who are under age 40 can protect themselves by keeping their distance
from other people, washing hands with soap, and wearing masks. Like
elders, those who have the comorbid disease have to take the vaccine.
Especially the people who have a disease like TV, HIV, diabetes, and
others have to take the corona vaccine it will benefit them.
Interviewer- What kind of benefit will get?
Respondent- Already they are taking other medications if they are
infected by coronavirus they will have a high probability to die, so they
should be vaccinated.
Interviewer- Do you get vaccinated?
Respondent- Still now I didn’t take the vaccine, but I will be vaccinated
in the future.
Interviewer- Why you didn't get the vaccine?
Respondent- They didn’t come to my home to give me the vaccine that is
why, if they came to my home I will be vaccinated.

your home and to give you the vaccine?

vaccinated, but until now the vaccine didn't come to kebele

feeling of fatigue for 2 days and after 2 days it will not have pain.

Respondent – yes I'm afraid of the pain that my friends told me.
Interviewer- Have you heard about the coronavirus vaccine for children?
Respondent- yes I have heard.
Interviewer- how do you see the vaccine to give to children from its
safety?
Respondent- if the children get the vaccine it will have benefits for
them and their parents too to protect from the virus.
Interviewer- if the vaccine comes will you vaccinate your children?
Respondent- yes she will be vaccinated
Interviewer- any reason why wants to vaccine your children?
Respondent- just that is for the sake of protecting my children from the
virus.
Interviewer- Do you think giving the vaccine to children will have side
effects?
Respondent- I think it will not have any other side effect other than
protecting against the pandemic.
Interviewer- how do you see the impact of media on the corona vaccine?Respondent- the television is always talking about the importance of
taking the vaccine

Interviewer - What is coronavirus for you?
Respondent - The virus is a very bad pandemic it has a lot of problems
for humans we should vaccinate and we need to keep ourselves by washing
our hands, by not making any physical contact with other people, and by
cleaning the bags of dust in our environment.
Interviewer - What do you think about covid 19 vaccines?
Respondent- To protect ourselves from the coronavirus we have to get
vaccinated before we are affected by the virus and we have to take
protective measures from the pandemic.
Interviewer -What kind of protective mechanisms can you tell more?
Respondent- For example, we went to the hospital and got a vaccine this
is one of the protective measurements in addition to this we need to keep
our hygiene like washing our hands every time and not touching the things
that will be the cause of the coronavirus.
Interviewer-which group of people are supposed to take the vaccine in
your perception?
Respondent- The people who have a comorbid disease like Asthma, blood
pleasure, diabetes, HIV, and other disease have to take the vaccine,
otherwise if they are infected by the coronavirus they will die. I took
the vaccine as soon as it started to give to the people because I have
serious asthma. In addition to the people with the comorbid disease,
those who are elder more than 50 years have to vaccinate.
Interviewer-did you take the vaccine
Respondent- Yes I’m vaccinated
Interviewer– where you got the vaccine
Respondent- hospital
Interviewer – You went by yourself or
Respondent- Yes I went by myself as soon as I heard the vaccine is
available
Interviewer-How long it has been you got the vaccine
Respondent- It has been more than 3 months
Interviewer-why you got vaccinated
Respondent- I have serious asthma and I have heard that for those who
have asthma if they are infected by the virus it will be very hard, so I
became afraid and I got the vaccine
Interviewer-if you don't have asthma attack will you take the vaccine?
Respondent- Yes I will get the vaccine. If it is helpful to protect me
taking the vaccine is mandatory.
Interviewer-have you heard about the coronavirus vaccine for children?
Respondent- Yes I heard
Interviewer-what do you think about that?
Respondent- that is a very good thing I advise them to be vaccinated,
because it is very important to protect themselves from the virus.
Interviewer - How do you see the vaccine to give to children from its
safety?
Respondent- I got vaccinated and it doesn’t bring that much harm other
than a fever for 2consequative days, but for children, the vaccine will
be painful, because it has a fever and a feeling of fatigue.
Interviewer – what do you think about the side effect of giving the
vaccine to children?
Respondent - I think children taking the vaccine don’t harm their future.
The government is saying taking the vaccine is a very good thing to
protect from the disease. If it has negative consequences the government
will not give the vaccine to children. Instead, it will be important to
protect themselves and their parents from the virus.
Interviewer -if the vaccine comes will you vaccinate your children?Respondent - to protect ourselves from the pandemic I will do what the
government is saying. If the vaccine has side effects the government will
not give it to the people, so if the vaccine comes for children I will
vaccinate my children.

Respondent- regarding religion God said protect yourself and help me. We
pray to God at the same time we protect ourselves from the virus.
Interviewer-what is the impact of media on the corona vaccine?
Respondent- I heard every day that taking the vaccine is a good thing to
protect from the virus by television and radio.

Q1. How do you percive/ think of COVID-19?
R: My insight about COVID-19 is deadly, contagious, disease. The mode of
transmission is through coughing. It affects all age groups
Q2. What you perceive/think about COVID-19 vaccine?
R: The vaccine is very important, especially for those with older ages,
pregnant, cardiac disease, Diabetic, and hypertensive patients
Q2.1. why, do you think it is mainly important for this group?
R: The virus harms and kills those groups more than others
Q3. Have you vaccinated?
R: No
Q3.1. Why hadn't you been vaccinated?
R: Because, because I am lactating by the time and now, and there is no
research done to show effectiveness of the vaccine for lactating mothers.
In addition, the fact that it will cause blood clotting is also a reason
for not getting vaccine.
Q3.2. What is your information sources regarding it will cause blood
clotting?
R: Because, I knew a person who have died of the blood clotting
Q3.3. Whom do you think will get vaccine?
R: The vaccine should be primarily be given for those with older ages,
pregnant, obese, cardiac disease, Diabetic, and hypertensive patients,
because it harms and kill them more.
Q4. Could you vaccinate your child if the vaccine is available?
R: No, I couldn’t vaccinate children by this time
Q4.1. Why are you not willing to vaccinate children?
R: The first is the virus is not affecting the children age group and the
vaccine is important for those who could not tolerate the virus. I even
think the vaccine itself harms the children than the virus.
R: In terms of effectiveness, I don’t fear of will not work, as far the
vaccine was working for adults it will also works for the child. But, the
side effects might harm them and the disease is not mortal in child.
R: In terms of side effects, there are rumors that it will harms organ
after long term, there are also rumors that it will even kill after long
times, but I don’t accept that.
R: Again there are rumors that the vaccine is a sign of beast, as it is
linked with ‘666’. They (community) linked with bible sources to claim it
as a sign of evil.
R: I prefer the vaccine to be given for age greater than 12, but I will
not let them get vaccine before they turn 12 years.

Q1-what do you think of Covid-19
R1- I first heard about covid-19 virus on March 2011 EC. As I know the
virus is dangerous and has no cure. There are some strategies set to
prevent Covid-19 acquisition. Avoid physical contact including hand
shaking and use face mask are one of the strategies to protect
transmission of covid19 virus. When I first heard about the vaccine, I
prepared myself to take the vaccine.
Q2- What is your view about the vaccine?
R2-as far as I know, diseases which have no treatment can be prevented by
vaccines. In my understanding we can prevent covid-19 by taking vaccines
like other serious childhood illnesses. I strongly fear the disease
because it kills many people worldwide.In our town Dilla, negligent
people who fail to avoid physical contacts were died of covid-19. Because
they thought that there is no Covid-19 virus in Dilla. I took the firs
dose and I am ready to take the subsequent vaccine doses.
I didn’t have any strange feeling about the vaccine, thus I have the same
as others vaccine since I have also took other types of vaccine
Q3 -who should receive the vaccine first?
R3-those individuals who are at high risk of acquiring Covid-19 due to
their occupational nature should take the vaccine priorly. Those who have
frequent contact with many people due to their occupation,people with
concurrent illnesses should get priority. “I have sinusitis if I get
covid 19 virus ,the co-infection could worsen my prognosis,so I fear of
Covid 19 virus.” individuals in contact with many people like teachers,
students, transport service providers and those who work in markets and
shops should get priority in receiving vaccine doses.
Students were also advised to take, as claasroom arrangements in our set
up are below standards. Students per class is more than the recommended,
which makes them more vulnerable
Q4-what initiates you to receive covid-19 vaccine?
R4- being a sinusitis patient pushes me to take covid-19 vaccines early.
I have respiratory problem (sinusitis) if I catched by covid-19 which
also affect the respiratory system the combined effect of both diseases
might compromise my survival.
Q5-what is your view of the covid 19 vaccine from religious aspect?
In my churches, when I told them that I took vaccine others feel like I
have no faith in my religion. But I consider it as not sin because we are
taking contraceptives so the vaccine doesn’t differ from other drugs and
vaccines. I don’t accept the rumor that this vaccine is related with
Satanism(666). If I consider this vaccine as Satanism I have to select
all other drugs come from outside world which is in evitable. So I don’t
want to relate every drug from Satanism perspective and also I will teach
others on this regards
God gave us brain to think and search for medicine, thus vaccine is also
among them
Q6-what is your view of the covid 19 vaccine from cultural aspect?
R6-I hear nothing whether the vaccine is related with culture. I consider
this covid-19 vaccine like other vaccines unless no cultural evidence is
available
Q7 did your managerial position influence you to take the vaccine
R7 –I was not influenced by my position. There are many leaders who are
not vaccinated. Once I took the vaccine before it ends and told others to
vaccinate. There are peoples who took vaccines following my vaccination
by considering me as a role model.
Q8-Readiness to vaccinate children
In my thought old aged peoples should took vaccines before children.
Because children can transmit the diseases but have less to be
complicated and dead by covid 19 virus.“I have a 17 years old child who is a high school student. She was
informed at school to take covid-19 vaccine voluntarily but I have
delayed her from taking vaccines. In my view teenagers were less likely
to be attacked by covid-19”.
There are rumors spoken in our village about home to home covid-19
vaccination. People consider that home to home vaccination is to reduce
Ethiopian population by vaccinating the fertile population. Also the
community said that Old ages do not took the vaccine since they end
fertility, but I disagree with this idea.
Q9- safety and effectiveness of vaccines
R9- I have no doubt about the vaccine effectiveness and safety. I took
the first dose I haven’t seen any problem. But I hesitate to vaccinate my
children. Why children are allowed to take covid-19 vaccine is still my
question.
Q10 media influence
R10 the information provided from media are focused on the Severity of
disease and transmission ways. But information about covid-19 preventive
vaccines are limited
Q11 additional points
The need to vaccinate children is still in doubt in our community so we
need further clear explanations from trust government sources. People
assume that vaccines came to our country are not as effective as the
foreign citizens receives. And it should also be emphasized why, vaccine
for children is lately proclaimed?
There are also rumors in the community, that it will affect fertility,
which I will not more agree.A father, educational status= masters, family size <18= 3, occupation =

Q1 what is your general view about covid 19
R1 Covid-19 is a global pandemic which affects all parts of the community
regardless of age and sex. Though there is no effective treatment,
preventive vaccines are available. So I believe that all individuals
shall be vaccinated.
Q2 what is your view about the vaccine
I hear rumors that tell covid-19 vaccine is not safe, but I try to take
information from vaccinated individuals and got no complication or
complaint.
Q2.1- who should took the vaccine
In my point of view covid-19 vaccine should be addressed for those
oldages. Why?b/c if those groups are attacked by the virus the
transmission become dramaticand its impact will be worse. Inaddition
those who are in low economic status and people living in rural
communities shall receive the vaccine priorly. This is because those
group of people cannot get the available vaccines easily.
Q3. Are you vaccinated?No I ‘m not. Because I suppose that the vaccine
can have Sid effects.
Q3.1 What type of side effects? .I don’t know whether it is
scientifically proved or not but I suppose that the vaccine could cause
blood clot problem. Other people assumes different hypotheses for
example; some say that it could cause infertility, others also think that
it could introduce the virus to the body again and cause infection.
Q4- your view from religion and culture
R4- I have no view the vaccine in relation to culture and religion
Q5- vaccine for children
R5 – I am ready to vaccinate my child for any importance. I asked peoples
who took vaccines and got positive attitude towards the vaccine. Now I am
ready to vaccinate my children.
Q6- side effects and safety
Q6 –as I know like all other drugs the covid-19 vaccine could have side
effects but no special consideration for vaccine side effects.
Q7- media and information sources
R7 – I am active media user including internets. The influence of media
in providing information might be positive or negative. The information
provided from media shall include current, local, national and global
statistics.
Q8- Covid-19 vs traditional medicine
There are people who refuse medical care for religion or cultural
concerns.
Additionals
Information provision and awareness creation should be addressed for the
community by involving community leaders,key stakeholders and religious
leaders. If those community stake holders and community leaders receive
the covid-19 vaccine many people in their community could raise its
awareness about the vaccine.Age: 28, Sex: Male, Family member: 4, Marital status: Married, Job:

I- What do you think about covid?
P-Covid is very concerning disease.It is spreading from time to time.It
affects people of all ages and requires caution. I do understand covid in
this way.
I-What do you think about covid 19 vaccine?
P-There are mixed up and different information.It is decide which one to
believe and which one to leave. I myself didn't receive covid vaccine
because all what I hear about the vaccine are opposite to each other and
relate vaccine with negative effects.There are different sayings about
the vaccine. From the information I have, vaccine is made in abroad like
America and England.The vaccine they take by themselves may be different
from vaccine they send for us.It is said once you take the vaccine, they
can easily control you.Some people say vaccine is related religion and
devilish.Therefore, they say you should take the vaccine. Because of
these reason I was fear of it and still didn't take the vaccine.
I-Who you think should get the vaccine?
P- As it was said, people who should take the vaccine are those who have
serious disease like diabetes mellitus. But I have heard that people who
get the vaccine may suffer from side effects. As I have heard, it can
cause blood clot and also heard people who died after taking the
vaccine.When you hear this, it is a bit worrisome.
I-Why do you think they should get the vaccine?
P- I think, it is because, covid-19 is usually more severe to these
people and more likely to killl them when compared to healthy people.
I-Covid-19 vaccine is being given for children. Do you let your children
get vaccinated?
P- 'Ere Ere'! I never let them vaccinated. How do you think I let my
child to take the vaccine without taking it my self? How can I allow? I
have a fear on this. What if something happens to my child? It is said
illuminant and people should not take the vaccine. If you receive the
vaccine, you will be under the control and become member of illuminant
group. Even I don't believe in vaccine.What if something happens to my
child? What if they are performing trial on my child? I don't think I
will allow the vaccine for my children.
I-What is your concern about covid-19 vaccine?
P-My concern is who is going to be responsible if is any problem happen
to my child after taking the vaccine? If my child becomes sick, if some
thing dangerous happens? These are my concerns.
I- Would you tell if your religion and religious leaders have influenced
you for not taking the vaccine?
P- I have heard in churches when they teach to get the vaccine and also I
know they are taking the vaccine. But after taking, I have heard they
were complaining headache and extra... On the other way, there is a
television I'm following and it teaches against the vaccine. It may be
due to this reason or my personal fear that I haven't yet received the
vaccine and don't let my children get the vaccine....I think this.
I-How do you the role of media on covid vaccine?
P-It is what I have said so far. There is variable information. It is
difficult to take this information as real information because when you
open this it says this, when you open other it says other and unrelated
information. You also see different things from facebook. I am really
confused where to get real and convincing information. What I have heard
and saw from different medias have impacted me negatively.I could not get
true information.
I-At the end, anything you want to add?
P- The government should give us real information about covid-19 vaccine
and current situation of covid-19 disease, on how to protect ourselves. Ithink we should pay attention to protection mechanism and government
should tell us how.Gender: Male, Age: 41, School Level: 10+1, Marital status: Married,

I: What do you say about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)? What do you
think?
P? I think coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the same to other disease. I
believe this as like as other diseases and I got vaccinated against
COVID-19. Although there are different opinions about the disease and its
vaccine, I have been vaccinated accepting what the science approved.
Before I got vaccinated, I was used sanitizer and wore a mask. After
vaccination (as I was vaccinated), I ignored using sanitizer, mask and
other mechanisms. Believe in the vaccine with confidence; we have stopped
using sanitizer and wearing mask. Currently, both vaccinated and nonvaccinated communities ignored protection mechanisms against Coronavirus
in my local area.
I: What do you think about the coronavirus vaccine?
P: I belief in science. But, there are lots of opinions about Coronavirus
disease (COVID-19). For example, some say that the vaccine is a
deliberate invention. Nothing it works: whether vaccinated or not people
are infected with COVID-19. Due to this opinion, many people are not
vaccinated. They also associate the coronavirus and the vaccine with
faith. They see it as a plague. There are those who believe that the
vaccine is the work of Satan. And they think that the only way to prevent
it is; through faith, fasting, and prayer.
I: Who do you think should be vaccinated against coronavirus?
P: People with associated illness who are unable to cope with the
disease; those who have respiratory problems; people with heart disease
and various diseases. I believe that there are scientific statements that
they will easily be infected by the virus. I would like these people to
get the vaccine first. Still, I will happy if children at school would be
vaccinated, especially KG children. Because, I think more and more
students are coming home with the disease. It is a good idea to get
vaccinated them, as the disease may be present at their place of study.
We parents are at home; I'm afraid they will bring the disease from
school to us.
I: Have you been vaccinated?
P: Yes! I was vaccinated.
I: How many times have you been vaccinated?
P: Only one more time; the latest vaccine which is called JohnsonJohnson; that is the vaccine given only once.
I: Why did you get vaccinated?
P: Primary, to protect the corona; secondary, even if I get infected with
coronavirus, it will increase my immune system.
I: What do you think about the coronavirus vaccine for children?
P: I think it is good; because it is something that science has proven
and believed. Children gather in a very crowded place at school, even if
they have the common cold, they will come home with the disease.
Coronavirus is a contagious disease, so I think they bring it home. I
think vaccination of the elderly at first is that young people can cope
with the disease. On the other hand, the priority for the elderly is may
be due to a shortage of medicine for all ages. However, if vaccine
accessible, it is good to give the vaccine to all ages so that everyone
can be vaccinated. Because the disease can affect all ages; it does not
select infant or adult; it does not say big or small.
I: What do you think about the safety of the vaccine?
P: Many people think that if I go and get vaccinated, I will get another
disease. But, I have seen it for myself, I have not seen any disease on
the day I was vaccinated; maybe I felt a little hot.
I: What are your concerns about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
vaccine?P: Nothing to worry about. I look at it like any other vaccine: It looks
like the previous vaccines. Scientists in every country, even in our
country, have proven that it does not cause any harm. From the
information I have; there is nothing to worry about, even, after I was
vaccinated.
I: Do you allow your children to be vaccinated against COVID-19 vaccine?
P: If science believes and the government says to vaccinate, why not?
They will be vaccinated.
I: In what sense are you willing to vaccinate your children?
P: The reason I was willing to vaccine is that I think they should get
vaccinated.
I: How do you see the media's impact on the coronavirus vaccine?
P: In fact, I believe media influence is now gone. This is because the
media, which focuses on the above orders, only warms up one season and
fades away. Because in the past, when you open any media, you hear about
coronavirus; there were many of healthcare workers including doctors who
invited by Medias and gave information about the diseases. Almost no now;
I think the reason is that I do not understand whether their focus is
related to the current situation in our country. I do not know if the
disease has subsided or not. The information had to be presented by the
media from time to time. However, there is no information available on
the media about coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its vaccines.
Nowadays, we often hear about war in the media. If we hear about the
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its vaccine, it is knowledge; it gave
us insight.
Another thing that can add to the media's impact on the vaccine is that
it would be good for the public to learn on the radio. Once upon a time
there was a song about coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in every channel;
it was just the media attention. No attention is being paid to any media
right now. Maybe when we go to the bank, we remember the mask, which we
take out of our pockets. Those vaccinated people; almost we do not use
the mask because we trust the vaccine.
I: Do you think there is negative impact of media on the vaccine?
P: Yes! Not everyone is the same. There is maybe someone who negatively
interperete the vaccine on social media. But, I believe in science; I
believe the vaccine is safe and effective and, so I have been vaccinated.
On the contrary, I think it is a difference of opinion among those who
reject the vaccine.
I: Do you think that the vaccine has anything to do with religion or
belief?
P: I do not think so. But, there are preachers in every religious who
have no know how about the vaccine. These preachers of religious persons
tried to link the vaccine with Satan work and devil spirit. They must
teach man the right doctrine; it does not matter if he reads or teaches
the right thing. For example, in the past there was a negative attitude
towards antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS. But now, for example, in
the religion I follow, the fathers of religious teachers are once again
teaching the positive side of medicine: they teach and aware the
believers (followers) to take the medicine and the Holy water properly.
In similar aspect, it is must to teach the coronavirus vaccine as well; I
think they should make the community aware.
Rural communities in particular need education; the rural preacher, no
matter who he is, follows him; if he taught them what he wanted to say
about the vaccine, they would accept it. So I believe they should pass on
the right information about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its
vaccine, and teach the right education.
I ? If there is anything to add to what we have discussed so far...
P: I think it would be good if awareness given for religious people
(preachers) in rural areas. Because science is different thing and belief
is another thing.I: We have finished our conversation. Thank you so much for your
willingness to give me your precious time.Sex: F, Age: 24, Education: grade 8, Marital status: Married, Family

Q: What do you think (say) about coronavirus disease (COVID-19)?
R: Coronavirus is a disease that requires care. We put on a mask; I think
we need to be careful about our hygiene. I think I have to keep hygienic
and careful because it is contagious.
Q: What do you think about the coronavirus vaccine?
R: There are those who have been vaccinated and not been vaccinated. For
example, we (my family and I were not vaccinated. Because they did not
come from house to house, we were not told to go to the health center and
get vaccinated. I and my families are not vaccinated; the unvaccinated
neighbours are more with us! The reason we were not vaccinated is that
the house to house vaccine campaign did not come to us. Since the
government start to give vaccination house to house, giving vaccination
for everyone is the duty of government and jobs of healthcare workers.
Q: Who should get the COVID-19 vaccine?
R: Over 50 years of age; elders, people with serious disease, people with
comorbid disease especially diabetes; hypertension should be vaccinated.
Coronavirus disease can also lead them to death if they would infect with
it.
Q: What do you think about the coronavirus vaccine to children? What do
you think if it comes to children?
R: Babies don't have that much trouble. Because they do not drink; they
do not chew khat; they do not smoke, so neither COVID-19 nor its vaccine
can affect children. No. There are many things that we (adults) do. We,
adults, do many things: drink more; chew khats, and our lungs can be
damaged for a variety of reasons. Pediatric lungs, on the other hand, are
relatively clean and do not need to be vaccinated. Coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) is a disease from God due to sin of adults, so what sin do
children need to be vaccinated against? Children do not need to be
vaccinated because they have not committed any sin. The vaccine is not
needed for children but for us.
Q: What are your concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine? Are you worried?
R: If I take it, it will benefit me. But for children, whether they take
it or not, it does not help. But it would be nice if I could take it. It
also means a lot to me. I have no other worries.
Q: Do you allow your children to be vaccinated against COVID-19 vaccine?
R: I will not vaccinate my child. Because it is not allowed for babies.
If allowed and told to do, I will allow to be vaccinated.
Q: How do you see the media's impact on the COVID-19 vaccine?
R: There are places where the information has not been accessed. All
communities are not equally access information about the vaccine. The
government did not order it, but the information was not available to
everyone. It is better if the government order the all medias in order to
transmit the right and updated information about COVID-19 and its
vaccine. The key is to get information to the public from the government.Sex : Female Age=60, Family size =11, Education: grade 12 complete,

Q: What do you think (say) about coronavirus disease (COVID-19)?
R: we face many catastrophes and we pray for God to remove covid-19 from
the land. I believe it will extinct from the world.
Q: What do you think about the coronavirus vaccine?
R: I didn’t take vaccine; even I will never take vaccine in future. Why?
I don’t know someone in our community took the vaccine and became
seriously ill. If will be forced to take covid-19 vaccine, i will prefer
getting into jail.
Q: Who should to get the COVID-19 vaccine?
I: No body shall receive vaccine. God orders the diseases also he cures
the disease. God saves since early childhood so he remains our savior.
Those who take vaccines are becoming ill. I may die but covid-19 will
never contact me. I believe in god the disease is evil spirit.
Q: What do you think about the coronavirus vaccine to children?
I: No child shall receive the vaccine; only God saves them. I don’t trust
vaccine, I trust only God. He saves us from many threats and obstacles.
It is meaning less whether someone take vaccine or not.
Q: How do you see the media's impact on the COVID-19 vaccine?
I: I have been hearing and seeing about it from media, but no fear comes
to me.
